        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            BeaedCorpusExpress is a responsive site for an industrial tag manufacturer serving energy and manufacturing clients.
            It highlights materials (stainless, brass, plastics), engraving and printing options, barcodes and serialization, and a clear lead-capture path for quotes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Role: end-to-end design and build. Goals: showcase capabilities, keep load fast on mobile, and make it easy for procurement teams to request quotes.

        <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            This fullstack sign configurator and order portal, conceived in October 2025, was built for a company making standard and custom industrial-grade tags and placards. It shows my ability to design, implement, and refine a complete software solution end to end.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a design and engineering lens, I modeled business rules (size-to-price mappings, category estimators) as a single source of truth, then paired them with a responsive UI that includes live SVG previews, dynamic cards, and clear navigation between portfolio and capstone pages. I added validation, defensive DOM handling, client-side PDF proof generation with email workflows, and kept accessibility in mind by separating data, logic, rendering, and side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            This refactor sharpened how I communicate design intent, align shared components for collaboration, and keep a security-aware mindset in client-side handling under tight timelines.

    <section id="enhancement-two">
        <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement focuses on the algorithmic core of the same sign configurator: a browser-based designer with live SVG preview backed by a Node/Express API.
        </p>
        <p>
            I organized business rules into data-driven tables for size and category pricing, built a shared quote engine for client/server consistency, and added a classifier to streamline product selection. A font-fit layout algorithm dynamically adjusts text in the SVG to keep it readable and properly scaled. Modular pricing logic, session-based auth, and order handling replaced ad hoc UI code with reusable compute layers.
        </p>
        <p>
            These structured algorithms demonstrate applying CS principles, managing trade-offs for reliability and scalability, and using shared logic and tooling to deliver consistent results even while the backend was taking shape.
        </p>

    <section id="enhancement-three">
        <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
        <p>
            This iteration spotlights database integration for the same industrial tag configurator. It moves the app from static data to structured persistence and retrieval.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wired in MongoDB to store quotes and product data, keeping size-to-price mappings and estimators as a single source of truth while the UI stayed responsive with live SVG previews and dynamic cards. Validation, defensive DOM handling, and client-side PDF proof generation now sit on top of persisted data, tested via Postman to ensure consistent behavior across scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tackling databases strengthened my use of modern tools, reinforced a security-minded approach to data persistence and API design, and improved how I document and test for teams that rely on accurate data to make decisions.
